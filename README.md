fastest route a knight chess piece can take to go to a certain position

**I actually started using BFS for the search algorithm because I knew it's faster than DFS in this type of search. But I switched to DFS for some reason and I made a lot progress and then I finished the project. Now I don't have the energy to do BFS for this project. I decided to just move on since I still have a long way to go to finish the course.

**I learned about the mutability of arrays the hard way. The warnings about them in the earlier parts of the course were true. But I know now how to deal with them so I'm good.
